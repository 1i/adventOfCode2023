Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you four copies each of cards 4 and 5.
card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you  eight copies of card 5.
Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards.
Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards.
Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with
1 instance of card 1,
2 instances of card 2,
4 instances of card 3,
8 instances of card 4,
14 instances of card 5,
1 instance of card 6.
